China's Spy chip
- This topic matters as it relates to the topic in this module because learning how motherboard can be manipulated and learning the basics of its functions helps me understand how something as a hardware hack with a small chip can become something diffucult for companies and governments to deal with.
  
1. hardware hack is dirrectly affecting the motherboard with chips that were not inteded to be there. Harder to pull of. More devastating
   a sofware hack is via wifi and interfiring with servers in order to obtain personal information and more.
2. The two ways a hacker can interfere
   1. interderection, manipulating during transit
   2. changes from the very begining.
3. middle man posing as workers from companies as supermicro will demand managers to change the motherboards actual desing and shipping them off to companies that used their motherboards that are used in apple computers and others. Could of been chinesse spies. Since Supermicro had subcontractors to help them meet their higher demands.
4. U.S intelligence agencies began following supermicro supply in reverse. communication intercepts, tapped informants, tracked key individuals through phones. In the end they traced malicious chips to 4 subcontracting companies.

## Analogy
-The china hardware hack attack has showed me how little and inmense the IT world is. It can affect multibillionare as well as us the regular person. Sure there is a lot of information to learn and as im learning the basics i know there is some interesting real life issues we face in the IT world that ill be able to understand. How 
HOw IT has affected everyone from politics, foreign affairs etc.

## Things i want to know more about.
1. how are manufactures in a country like china can be manipulated into causing a world fenomenon
2. why are these things not talked about more in real life.
3. will this happen again since the evolution of technology keeps advancing?
