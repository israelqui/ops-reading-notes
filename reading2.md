# Reading 2

## Statement
-this topic matters because its important to understand the basic of computer hardware and its function to further my knowdlegde and undertand concepts how to manipulate them in future lessons.
## Question
1. In a CPU more cores can improve performance. Althoguh it depends on what type of sofware you will use. the better software the faster the CPU. for a good gaming PC 6 cores is right.
2. the motherboard has to be compatible with the processor. Wifi, Bloototh, etc.
3. the tradeoffs id evaluate while selecting storage a storage device are for an ssd the lower you can use as your boot drive for running your OS, and higher storage for HDD for your files
4. I would explain that i had an issue with my apple computer with a 8GB Ram that wouldnt be able to perform as i wanted to since i use it for school, running programs like Music composing apps, Dj apps and now more school. these programs need a computer with high performance if you have multiple uses. If you just want to use it for simple things keep keep the budget at a minimun.
## Analogy 
- This topic is key into understanding what you want and need on a computer. You dont have to go all out in hardware if money is an issue if you want a simple working reliable computer. Unlike me i decided to go into IT i need and want more in a computer to make it work to its full potential since i use other more demanding apps.

## Things i want to know more about
-reliability of each company when it comes to their equipment.
-how much is to much and do you need to much?
-whats a peak a computer can work?
